# Verification

Repository policy and focused testing or debugging workflows own commands and completion.

## Choose Evidence

Identify the changed path and observable. Prefer the narrowest reliable seam: public output, state transition, protocol effect, or another stable observable. Treat a source shape, private call sequence, or incidental snapshot as supporting evidence unless that representation is a declared contract or guard target; name it and scope the claim.

## Prove Sensitivity

A new or changed evidentiary check needs one credible negative control:

- observe the pre-fix failure;
- temporarily revert or mutate behavior;
- plant a scoped violation; or
- use a known violating input.

Confirm the intended failure, then restore the exact pre-control state, including every pre-existing user change. Existing compilers, syntax checks, and unchanged tests need no newly planted defect. If no safe control exists, report green without proved sensitivity and state that limit.

Derive expected behavior from the request or authoritative contract. A characterization names the behavior frozen and why; copied current output alone is not a specification.

## Admit Suppressions Narrowly

Admit a suppression only when the source is immutable within the authorized task and repository policy recognizes the boundary, owner, and removal path. Use the narrowest mechanism and record at the site:

- source and why it cannot be corrected;
- owner and removal condition; and
- residual risk or coverage gap.

Otherwise fix the cause or return the failure. Baseline growth, a skipped check, weakened assertion, or analysis-scope escape is a suppression regardless of label.
